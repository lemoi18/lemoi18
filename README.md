## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hi, I'm Lars-Erik Bakkland Moi

🎓 Master's student in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) at the University of Agder. Passionate about creating innovative solutions in AI, with a focus on speech technologies like Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS).

💡 My current projects include exploring phonetic ASR models, voice conversion, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. I'm working on developing robust solutions for Norwegian language tasks using both BERT and Conformer models.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

- **ASR & TTS Models:** Developing Joint CTC-S2S phoneme-level ASR models for voice conversion and alignment tasks, along with phonetic BERT models.
- **Text Normalization:** Building efficient pipelines for text normalization in Norwegian using BERT models.
- **Azure & Cloud Technologies:** Mastering Microsoft Azure with a focus on optimizing Virtual Machines, Azure AI services, and integrating these with AI models.

## 🌟 Featured Work

- 🧪 - **WandB Activity:** [![WandB](https://img.shields.io/badge/WandB-View%20Profile-blue)](https://wandb.ai/lemoi18): Check out my latest experiments, including ASR performance metrics and TTS training visualizations.
- 🌐 **[My Portfolio](https://github.com/your_username)**: Explore my projects, including:
  - A Streamlit app for ASR text-mel alignment.
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with Azure Search integration.
  - Diffusion Transformer models with LoRA for voice synthesis.

## 📚 Recent Achievements

- Completed a Fall 2024 internship at NOV APL, where I developed a search tool to help quickly find and navigate the most relevant sections within technical documents. This tool addressed the challenge of reviewing hundreds of technical specifications by using semantic and large language model embeddings for accurate searches. Results included percentage-based matches with PDF references, and the integration of ChatGPT provided detailed answers based on the context of the retrieved sections.
- Developed a phonetic-level ASR model using the Conformer architecure, enhancing Norwegian language processing.

## 📅 What's Next?

- Continue to refine and optimize my ASR models for better phonetic accuracy in Norwegian.
- Expand my cloud expertise in Microsoft Azure, aiming to implement scalable AI solutions.
- Explore more in-depth use cases for voice conversion and diffusion models in TTS.
